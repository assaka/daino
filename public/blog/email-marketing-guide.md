**Expected results:** 55% open rate, 15% review rate

#### 4. Win-Back Campaign

## Best Practices for Higher Engagement

### Timing

- **Best days:** Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- **Best times:** 10am-2pm local time
- **Avoid:** Weekends, Monday mornings, Friday afternoons

### Content

- **Mobile-first:** 60%+ of emails are opened on mobile
- **One CTA:** Focus on a single action per email
- **Images:** Use sparingly, include alt text
- **Personalization:** Use {first_name}, product recommendations

### Deliverability

- Clean your list regularly (remove bounces, unsubscribes)
- Avoid spam trigger words
- Maintain consistent sending patterns
- Monitor sender reputation

### Subject Lines That Work

```
Works:
- "{first_name}, your cart is waiting"
- "24 hours left: Free shipping on everything"
- "New arrivals you'll love"

Avoid:
- "SALE SALE SALE!!!"
- "Open this email now!!!"
- "You won't believe..."
```
