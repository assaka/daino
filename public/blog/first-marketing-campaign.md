## Before You Start

Before creating your first campaign, make sure you have:

- [ ] **Email configuration set up** - Your sending domain and email provider configured
- [ ] **At least 10 subscribers** - A small list to start with
- [ ] **A clear goal** - What do you want to achieve?
- [ ] **Content ready** - Images, copy, and call-to-action planned

> **New to email marketing?** Start with a simple welcome campaign to new subscribers. It's the easiest way to learn the system while providing value.

## Step 1: Define Your Campaign Goal

Every successful campaign starts with a clear goal. Ask yourself:

### What do I want recipients to do?

| Goal | Campaign Type | Success Metric |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| Drive sales | Promotional | Revenue generated |
| Announce new products | Product launch | Clicks to product page |
| Build engagement | Newsletter | Open rate |
| Win back customers | Re-engagement | Purchases from inactive |
| Collect feedback | Survey | Response rate |

### Set a specific target

Instead of "increase sales," aim for "generate $500 in revenue from this campaign" or "achieve a 25% open rate."

---

## Step 2: Build Your Audience

### Navigate to Segments

1. Go to **Marketing > Segments**
2. Click **Create Segment**

### Choose Your Audience Type

**For your first campaign, we recommend starting with one of these segments:**

#### All Subscribers (Simplest)
- Best for: Announcements, newsletters
- Who: Everyone on your list
- Expected reach: 100% of list

#### Recent Purchasers
- Best for: Thank you campaigns, cross-sells
- Criteria: Purchased in last 30 days
- Expected engagement: Higher than average

#### New Subscribers
- Best for: Welcome campaigns, first-purchase offers
- Criteria: Signed up in last 7 days
- Expected engagement: Highest open rates

### Create a Basic Segment

1. Click **Create Segment**
2. Name it (e.g., "Recent Subscribers - Last 30 Days")
3. Add condition: `Signup Date` is `within last 30 days`
4. Click **Preview** to see matching customers
5. Click **Save Segment**

---

## Step 3: Create Your Campaign

### Navigate to Campaigns

1. Go to **Marketing > Campaigns**
2. Click **Create Campaign**

### Fill in Campaign Details

#### Campaign Name
Internal name for your reference. Be specific:
- Good: "Black Friday 2024 - 25% Off Sale"
- Avoid: "Campaign 1" or "Test"

#### Subject Line
What recipients see in their inbox. Make it count:

```
Good subject lines:
- "Your exclusive 20% off expires tonight"
- "{first_name}, we saved these just for you"
- "New arrivals you'll love"

Avoid:
- "Newsletter #45"
- "SALE SALE SALE!!!"
- "Don't miss out!!!"
```

**Tips for subject lines:**
- Keep under 50 characters (mobile-friendly)
- Create urgency without being spammy
- Use personalization ({first_name})
- Ask a question or make a promise

#### Preview Text
The secondary text shown after the subject in email clients:

```
Subject: "Your exclusive 20% off expires tonight"
Preview: "Use code SAVE20 at checkout. Free shipping on orders over $50."
```

## Step 4: Design Your Email

### Choose a Starting Point

**Option 1: Start from Template**
- Browse pre-built templates
- Customize colors, images, and text
- Best for: Quick campaigns

**Option 2: Start from Scratch**
- Full creative control
- Build using drag-and-drop blocks
- Best for: Unique designs

### Email Structure Best Practices

Follow this proven structure for your first campaign:

```
1. HEADER
   - Logo
   - Navigation links (optional)

2. HERO SECTION
   - Eye-catching image
   - Main headline
   - Primary CTA button

3. CONTENT BLOCKS
   - Featured products (2-4 max)
   - Or: Key message + supporting image

4. SOCIAL PROOF
   - Customer review
   - Or: Trust badges

```

### Design Tips

- One main message per email
- One primary call-to-action
- 2-3 colors maximum

**Mobile-first:**
- 60%+ of emails open on mobile
- Use large buttons (44px minimum)
- Single column layout works best

**Images:**
- Compress images for fast loading
- Always add alt text
- Don't rely solely on images for your message

## Step 5: Set Up Tracking

Tracking helps you understand what works. Enable these settings:

### Built-in Tracking (Automatic)
- **Opens**: When recipients open your email
- **Clicks**: Which links get clicked
- **Conversions**: Purchases from the campaign

### UTM Parameters
Add tracking to your links for Google Analytics:

```
Your link: https://yourstore.com/sale
With UTM: https://yourstore.com/sale?utm_source=email&utm_medium=campaign&utm_campaign=summer-sale
```

DainoStore can automatically add UTM parameters. Enable in campaign settings:
- utm_source: `email`
- utm_medium: `campaign`
- utm_campaign: `{campaign_name}`

|--------|---------|------|-------|
| Open Rate | Opens ÷ Delivered × 100 | 15-25% | 25%+ |
| Click Rate | Clicks ÷ Delivered × 100 | 2-5% | 5%+ |
| Click-to-Open Rate | Clicks ÷ Opens × 100 | 10-15% | 15%+ |
| Conversion Rate | Purchases ÷ Clicks × 100 | 1-3% | 3%+ |
| Unsubscribe Rate | Unsubs ÷ Delivered × 100 | <0.5% | <0.2% |
| Revenue Per Email | Revenue ÷ Delivered | Varies | Varies |

### What to Do with Results

**High open rate, low clicks?**
- Subject line is working, but content isn't compelling
- Try stronger CTAs and clearer offers

**Low open rate?**
- Subject line needs improvement
- Try different approaches, personalization

**High clicks, low conversions?**
- Landing page may need optimization
- Check price, shipping, or checkout friction
