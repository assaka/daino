# Heatmaps: See Exactly What Your Customers Do

*Last updated: November 2025*

## 🎯 What are Heatmaps?

Imagine you could watch a recording of **every visitor** on your site - where they click, where they scroll, where they get stuck. Heatmaps do exactly that, but better. They show you:

- 🔥 **Hot spots** (red) = Where people click the most
- ❄️ **Cold spots** (blue) = Where people ignore
- 📜 **Scroll depth** = How far down the page people actually read
- 👆 **Click patterns** = What draws attention vs what gets missed

It's like having X-ray vision for your website.

---

## 🤔 Why Heatmaps Matter

### Without Heatmaps:
```
You: "I put the 'Buy Now' button at the bottom"
Boss: "How do you know anyone sees it?"
You: "...I don't."
*Button gets zero clicks, you have no idea why*
```

### With Heatmaps:
```
Heatmap shows:
  - 95% of visitors only scroll 50% down the page
  - Your button is at 80% down (in the cold zone!)

You: "Ah! Let me move it up to the 40% mark"
*Button now in hot zone, +250% more clicks* 🎉
```

### Real Discoveries:

**What stores learned from heatmaps:**
- "Our search bar was invisible" → Moved it → +40% searches
- "Nobody saw our free shipping banner" → Made it sticky → +18% sales
- "People were clicking non-clickable images" → Made them clickable → +15% engagement
- "Checkout form was too long" → Shortened it → +22% completions

## 🎨 Types of Heatmaps

### 1. Click Heatmap
**What it shows:** Where people click

```
🔴 Red = Most clicks
🟠 Orange = Medium clicks
🟡 Yellow = Some clicks
🔵 Blue = Few clicks
⚪ White = No clicks
```

**Example discoveries:**
- "Add to Cart" button gets 1,000 clicks (hot! 🔥)
- Product description gets 50 clicks (warm)
- Footer links get 2 clicks (cold)

**Use it to:**
- See if important buttons are being clicked
- Find where people expect things to be clickable (but aren't)
- Identify distracting elements that steal clicks

---

### 2. Scroll Heatmap
**What it shows:** How far down the page people scroll

```
Top of page:    100% of visitors see this ████████████ 100%
Middle:          70% see this             ███████░░░░░  70%
Bottom:          15% see this             ██░░░░░░░░░░  15%
```

**Example discoveries:**
- 85% of visitors never scroll below the fold
- Your "Free Shipping" message is at 90% down (only 10% see it!)
- Move it to top → Massive impact

**Use it to:**
- See if people find your important content
- Identify the "dead zone" where nobody scrolls
- Optimize content placement

---

### 3. Move Heatmap (Mouse Tracking)
**What it shows:** Where people move their mouse

**Why it matters:**
- Eye tracking studies show: **People look where they point**
- Mouse movement predicts attention
- Helps identify confusion points

**Example discoveries:**
- Mouse hovering over price → People checking if it's a good deal
- Mouse moving in circles → People are confused/lost
- Quick mouse movements → Skimming, not engaged

---

### 4. Rage Click Heatmap
**What it shows:** Where people click multiple times rapidly

**Why it happens:**
- Element looks clickable but isn't
- Button doesn't respond fast enough
- User is frustrated

**Example discoveries:**
- 200 rage clicks on product images → "People want to zoom!"
- 150 rage clicks on disabled button → "They don't understand why it's disabled"

**Use it to:**
- Find frustration points
- Fix broken interactions
- Improve user experience

---

## 📖 How to Use Heatmaps in Your Store

### Step 1: Go to Heatmap Dashboard

Navigate to **Admin → Marketing → Heatmaps** (or visit `/admin/heatmaps`)

You'll see:
- A list of your pages
- Number of sessions recorded per page
- Options to view different heatmap types

### Step 2: Select a Page to Analyze

Click on any page:
```
📄 Homepage           2,456 sessions  [View Heatmap]
📦 Product Page       3,892 sessions  [View Heatmap]
🛒 Cart Page            892 sessions  [View Heatmap]
✅ Checkout Page        245 sessions  [View Heatmap]
```

**Pro tip:** Start with your highest-traffic pages for faster insights!

### Step 3: Choose Heatmap Type

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 👆 Click Heatmap               │ ← Where people click
│ 📜 Scroll Heatmap              │ ← How far they scroll
│ 🖱️  Move Heatmap               │ ← Where they look
│ 😡 Rage Click Heatmap          │ ← Where they get frustrated
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 4: Analyze the Data

**What to look for:**

🔴 **Red/Hot zones = Good!**
- Your CTA buttons should be red hot
- Important content should be in hot zones
- Navigation should show activity

⚪ **White/Cold zones = Problem!**
- Important buttons that are cold = invisible or confusing
- Large cold areas = wasted space
- Content nobody sees = need to move or remove

### Step 5: Make Changes

Based on insights:
1. Move important elements to hot zones
2. Remove/minimize cold zone elements
3. Fix rage click points
4. Ensure key content is above scroll depth

### Step 6: Test Again

After making changes:
1. Wait for 100+ new sessions
2. View new heatmap
3. Compare before/after
4. Measure impact on conversions!

## 📱 Mobile vs Desktop Heatmaps

### Key Differences:

**Desktop:**
- Larger screen = more content visible
- Mouse tracking available
- Horizontal space abundant
- Multiple CTAs can coexist

**Mobile:**
- Smaller screen = vertical scrolling
- Touch tracking (different from mouse)
- Thumb zone matters (bottom corners)
- One clear CTA works best

### Mobile-Specific Insights:

**Thumb Zone (Easy to Reach):**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│                 │
│                 │ ← Hard to reach
│                 │
│                 │
│  🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢  │ ← Thumb zone (hot!)
└─────────────────┘
```

**Solutions:**
- Put CTAs in bottom 30% of screen
- Avoid top corners on mobile
- Use sticky bottom bars for CTAs

---

## 🧪 Combining Heatmaps with A/B Testing

**The perfect workflow:**

### Step 1: Use Heatmaps to Find Problems
```
Heatmap shows: "Add to Cart" button is cold (only 100 clicks)
```

### Step 2: Form Hypotheses
```
Maybe: Button is too low on page
Maybe: Button color doesn't stand out
Maybe: Button text is confusing
```

### Step 3: A/B Test Solutions
```
Control: Blue button at 80% scroll depth
Variant A: Blue button at 40% scroll depth (moved up)
Variant B: Red button at 80% scroll depth (color change)
```

### Step 4: Heatmap Validates Results
```
After implementing winner:
Heatmap shows: "Add to Cart" is now red hot! 🔥
Clicks increased from 100 → 312 (+212%)
```

**Heatmaps show problems → A/B testing finds solutions → Heatmaps confirm success!**

---

## 📊 Analytics Integration

### How Heatmaps Connect with Your Analytics

Your analytics system tracks:
```
Page Views: 10,000
Add to Cart: 800 (8% conversion)
Checkouts: 600 (75% of cart)
Orders: 450 (75% of checkouts)
```

Heatmaps answer **WHY:**
```
Why only 8% add to cart?
  → Heatmap shows: Button is at 85% scroll, only 15% see it!

Why 25% abandon cart?
  → Heatmap shows: Rage clicks on shipping form (confusing!)

Why 25% abandon checkout?
  → Heatmap shows: Nobody sees payment security badges
```

### Tracking Improvements:

**Week 0 (Before heatmap optimizations):**
```
Conversions: 8%
```

**Week 2 (After moving CTA up):**
```
Heatmap: Button now in 60% scroll zone
Conversions: 10.5% (+31% improvement!)
```

**Week 4 (After fixing rage clicks):**
```
Heatmap: Rage clicks down 80%
Conversions: 12.1% (+51% total improvement!)
```

### DON'T:
❌ Make decisions from 10 sessions (not enough data)
❌ Ignore mobile heatmaps (50%+ of traffic!)
❌ Change everything at once (can't track what worked)
❌ Assume desktop patterns apply to mobile
❌ Forget to measure impact of changes
❌ Optimize pages with low traffic (waste of time)

## 🔢 Understanding the Numbers

### Click Counts:

**Context matters:**
```
Homepage:
  - Hero CTA: 500 clicks (Great! 50% of 1,000 visitors)
  - Footer link: 5 clicks (Normal for footer)

Product Page:
  - Add to Cart: 50 clicks (Bad! Only 5% of 1,000 visitors)
  - Product image: 800 clicks (People want zoom!)
```

### Scroll Percentages:

**Industry averages:**
```
Above fold (0%):     100% of visitors
First scroll (50%):   70-80% typical
Mid-page (75%):       40-50% typical
Bottom (100%):        10-20% typical
```

**Your targets:**
```
CTA buttons:    Must be in 70%+ zone
Value props:    Should be in 50%+ zone
Social proof:   Can be in 30%+ zone
Footer:         10-20% is normal
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Segment Your Heatmaps
```
All visitors     vs  New visitors only
Desktop users    vs  Mobile users
US visitors      vs  International
High spenders    vs  Window shoppers
```

Different segments have different behaviors!

### Tip 2: Watch for Patterns Over Time
```
Monday:    High engagement
Tuesday:   High engagement
...
Saturday:  Low engagement (people browsing, not buying)
Sunday:    Medium engagement

Insight: Optimize for weekday buyers!
```

### Tip 3: Use Heatmap Overlays
```
Layer 1: Click heatmap
Layer 2: Scroll depth
Layer 3: Your current layout

See: Where clicks happen vs where content is
```

### Tip 4: Export and Share
```
Take screenshots of:
- Before heatmap (with issues marked)
- After heatmap (showing improvements)
- Metrics before/after

Share with team to justify changes!
```

### Tip 5: Create Heatmap Review Routine
```
Weekly: Check for new issues
Monthly: Deep dive analysis
Quarterly: Compare trends

Track:
  - Which optimizations worked?
  - What patterns emerged?
  - Where to focus next?
```

## 🚀 Advanced Techniques

### Session Recordings + Heatmaps

**Combine for maximum insight:**

1. **Heatmap shows:** 200 rage clicks on checkout button
2. **Watch recording:** Why are people rage clicking?
   - Oh! Error message appears for 0.5 seconds then disappears
   - People don't see what's wrong
3. **Fix:** Make error persistent and clear
4. **Result:** -95% rage clicks, +18% checkouts

---

### Funnel Analysis with Heatmaps

**Track user journey:**
```
Homepage → Heatmap shows: 60% click "Shop Now"
  ↓
Category → Heatmap shows: 40% click product
  ↓
Product → Heatmap shows: 15% click "Add to Cart" (DROP!)
  ↓
Cart → Heatmap shows: 80% click "Checkout"
```

**Insight:** Biggest drop is at Product page → Focus optimization there!

---

### A/B Test Every Heatmap Insight

**Workflow:**
```
1. Heatmap reveals problem
2. Brainstorm 2-3 solutions
3. A/B test the solutions
4. Implement proven winner
5. New heatmap confirms improvement
6. Repeat!
```

**Example:**
```
Heatmap: "Add to Cart" button cold
  ↓
Hypothesis: Button color is the problem
  ↓
A/B Test: Blue vs Green vs Red
  ↓
Result: Green wins (+22%)
  ↓
New Heatmap: Button now hot! 🔥
```
