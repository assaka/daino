# Heatmaps: See Exactly What Your Customers Do

*Last updated: November 2025*

## What are Heatmaps?

Imagine you could watch a recording of every visitor on your site - where they click, where they scroll, where they get stuck. Heatmaps do exactly that, but better. They show you:

- **Hot spots** (red) = Where people click the most
- **Cold spots** (blue) = Where people ignore
- **Scroll depth** = How far down the page people actually read
- **Click patterns** = What draws attention vs what gets missed

It's like having X-ray vision for your website.

## Why Heatmaps Matter

### Without Heatmaps:
```
You: "I put the 'Buy Now' button at the bottom"
Boss: "How do you know anyone sees it?"
You: "...I don't."
*Button gets zero clicks, you have no idea why*
```

### With Heatmaps:
```
Heatmap shows:
  - 95% of visitors only scroll 50% down the page
  - Your button is at 80% down (in the cold zone!)

You: "Ah! Let me move it up to the 40% mark"
*Button now in hot zone, +250% more clicks*
```

### Real Discoveries:

**What stores learned from heatmaps:**
- "Our search bar was invisible" - Moved it - +40% searches
- "Nobody saw our free shipping banner" - Made it sticky - +18% sales
- "People were clicking non-clickable images" - Made them clickable - +15% engagement
- "Checkout form was too long" - Shortened it - +22% completions

## Types of Heatmaps

### 1. Click Heatmap
**What it shows:** Where people click

```
Red = Most clicks
Orange = Medium clicks
Yellow = Some clicks
Blue = Few clicks
White = No clicks
```

**Example discoveries:**
- "Add to Cart" button gets 1,000 clicks (hot!)
- Product description gets 50 clicks (warm)
- Footer links get 2 clicks (cold)

**Use it to:**
- See if important buttons are being clicked
- Find where people expect things to be clickable (but aren't)
- Identify distracting elements that steal clicks

---

### 2. Scroll Heatmap
**What it shows:** How far down the page people scroll

```
Top of page:    100% of visitors see this
Middle:          70% see this
Bottom:          15% see this
```

**Example discoveries:**
- 85% of visitors never scroll below the fold
- Your "Free Shipping" message is at 90% down (only 10% see it!)
- Move it to top - Massive impact

**Use it to:**
- See if people find your important content
- Identify the "dead zone" where nobody scrolls
- Optimize content placement

---

### 3. Move Heatmap (Mouse Tracking)
**What it shows:** Where people move their mouse

**Why it matters:**
- Eye tracking studies show: **People look where they point**
- Mouse movement predicts attention
- Helps identify confusion points

**Example discoveries:**
- Mouse hovering over price - People checking if it's a good deal
- Mouse moving in circles - People are confused/lost
- Quick mouse movements - Skimming, not engaged

---

### 4. Rage Click Heatmap
**What it shows:** Where people click multiple times rapidly

**Why it happens:**
- Element looks clickable but isn't
- Button doesn't respond fast enough
- User is frustrated

**Example discoveries:**
- 200 rage clicks on product images - "People want to zoom!"
- 150 rage clicks on disabled button - "They don't understand why it's disabled"

**Use it to:**
- Find frustration points
- Fix broken interactions
- Improve user experience

---

## How to Use Heatmaps in Your Store

### Step 1: Go to Heatmap Dashboard

Navigate to **Admin > Marketing > Heatmaps** (or visit `/admin/heatmaps`)

You'll see:
- A list of your pages
- Number of sessions recorded per page
- Options to view different heatmap types

### Step 2: Select a Page to Analyze

Click on any page:
```
Homepage           2,456 sessions  [View Heatmap]
Product Page       3,892 sessions  [View Heatmap]
Cart Page            892 sessions  [View Heatmap]
Checkout Page        245 sessions  [View Heatmap]
```

**Pro tip:** Start with your highest-traffic pages for faster insights!

### Step 3: Choose Heatmap Type

- Click Heatmap - Where people click
- Scroll Heatmap - How far they scroll
- Move Heatmap - Where they look
- Rage Click Heatmap - Where they get frustrated

### Step 4: Analyze the Data

**What to look for:**

**Red/Hot zones = Good!**
- Your CTA buttons should be red hot
- Important content should be in hot zones
- Navigation should show activity

**White/Cold zones = Problem!**
- Important buttons that are cold = invisible or confusing
- Large cold areas = wasted space
- Content nobody sees = need to move or remove

### Step 5: Make Changes

Based on insights:
1. Move important elements to hot zones
2. Remove/minimize cold zone elements
3. Fix rage click points
4. Ensure key content is above scroll depth

### Step 6: Test Again

After making changes:
1. Wait for 100+ new sessions
2. View new heatmap
3. Compare before/after
4. Measure impact on conversions!

## Reading a Click Heatmap

### Example: Product Page Analysis

```
Product Image (1,234 clicks) - People want to zoom!

Add to Cart (892 clicks) - Main CTA working

Product Tabs (234 clicks) - Some interest

Related Products (45 clicks) - Low interest

Footer (2 clicks) - Nobody goes here
```

### Insights:

**Hot spot #1: Product Image (1,234 clicks)**
- **Action:** Add image zoom feature
- **Expected impact:** +10-15% engagement

**Medium spot #2: Add to Cart (892 clicks)**
- **Action:** Button is working! Maybe test colors/text with A/B testing
- **Expected impact:** Optimize further with tests

**Cold spot #3: Related Products (45 clicks)**
- **Action:** Move higher on page OR remove entirely
- **Expected impact:** Reduce clutter, improve focus

**Dead zone #4: Footer (2 clicks)**
- **Action:** Confirm it's okay for footer to be cold
- **Note:** Footer is supposed to be low priority

## Reading a Scroll Heatmap

### Example: Homepage Analysis

```
100% - Everyone sees this (Hero Section / Fold)
80% - Most see this (Featured Products)
50% - Half see this (Benefits Section)
20% - Few see this (Testimonials)
5% - Almost nobody (Newsletter Signup - PROBLEM!)
```

### Insights:

**100% Zone (Above the fold):**
- Perfect for: CTA buttons, key messages, hero images
- Put your most important content here!

**50-80% Zone (Mid-page):**
- Good for: Product features, benefits, trust badges
- Still gets decent visibility

**20-50% Zone (Lower page):**
- Moderate priority content only
- Supplementary information

**Below 20% Zone (Bottom):**
- Newsletter signup only seen by 5% of visitors
- **Solution:** Move to 80%+ zone or make it a popup
- **Expected impact:** 15x more signups!

## Common Heatmap Patterns & What They Mean

### Pattern 1: "F-Pattern"
Users scan left-to-right at top, then scan left side going down. This is the typical reading pattern.

**How to use it:**
- Put key info on the left
- Use headlines to guide attention
- First few lines matter most

---

### Pattern 2: "Z-Pattern"
Users scan top-left to top-right, diagonal to middle-left, then bottom-left to bottom-right.

**How to use it:**
- Logo top-left, CTA top-right
- Key message in middle
- Secondary CTA bottom-right

---

### Pattern 3: "Click Cluster"
A specific element is very attractive. Good if it's your CTA! Bad if it's a distraction.

**Examples:**
- **Good:** "Add to Cart" button is red hot
- **Bad:** Random image getting all clicks (distraction)

---

### Pattern 4: "Dead Zone"
Content below a certain line gets no interaction. This is your "scroll depth limit."

**How to use it:**
- Move important content above this line
- Test shorter pages
- Add "scroll indicators" if needed

---

### Pattern 5: "Rage Clicks" (Multiple rapid clicks)

People expect an element to work but it doesn't.

**Common causes:**
- Image looks clickable but isn't
- Button is disabled with no explanation
- Link is broken
- Element loads slowly

**How to fix:**
- Make it clickable if it should be
- Add loading indicators
- Explain why it's disabled
- Fix broken interactions

---

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce Product Page

**Heatmap revealed:**
- 892 clicks on "Add to Cart" button (good)
- 1,234 clicks on product image (but no zoom feature!)
- 23 clicks on "Size Guide" (buried at bottom)

**Changes made:**
1. Added image zoom on click
2. Moved "Size Guide" link next to size selector
3. Made product images swipeable

**Results:**
- Image engagement: +45%
- Size Guide usage: +380% (from 23 to 87 clicks)
- Returns due to wrong size: -15%
- Overall conversions: +12%

---

### Example 2: Homepage Optimization

**Scroll depth showed:**
- 100% visitors see hero (top)
- 45% scroll to featured products
- 12% reach testimonials
- 3% see newsletter signup

**Changes made:**
1. Moved newsletter signup from bottom (3%) to hero section (100%)
2. Moved testimonials higher up
3. Removed content below 20% scroll line

**Results:**
- Newsletter signups: **+2,800%** (30/month to 870/month!)
- Page load faster (less content)
- Bounce rate: -8%

---

### Example 3: Checkout Page Issues

**Rage clicks detected:**
- 156 rage clicks on "Complete Order" button
- Button was disabled but no error message shown

**Changes made:**
1. Added error messages above button
2. Added loading spinner when processing
3. Highlighted required fields in red

**Results:**
- Rage clicks: -92% (156 to 12)
- Cart abandonment: -18%
- Completed orders: +23%

## Mobile vs Desktop Heatmaps

### Key Differences:

**Desktop:**
- Larger screen = more content visible
- Mouse tracking available
- Horizontal space abundant
- Multiple CTAs can coexist

**Mobile:**
- Smaller screen = vertical scrolling
- Touch tracking (different from mouse)
- Thumb zone matters (bottom corners)
- One clear CTA works best

### Mobile-Specific Insights:

**Thumb Zone (Easy to Reach):**
The bottom 30% of the mobile screen is the "thumb zone" - easiest area for users to tap.

**Solutions:**
- Put CTAs in bottom 30% of screen
- Avoid top corners on mobile
- Use sticky bottom bars for CTAs

## Combining Heatmaps with A/B Testing

**The perfect workflow:**

### Step 1: Use Heatmaps to Find Problems
```
Heatmap shows: "Add to Cart" button is cold (only 100 clicks)
```

### Step 2: Form Hypotheses
```
Maybe: Button is too low on page
Maybe: Button color doesn't stand out
Maybe: Button text is confusing
```

### Step 3: A/B Test Solutions
```
Control: Blue button at 80% scroll depth
Variant A: Blue button at 40% scroll depth (moved up)
Variant B: Red button at 80% scroll depth (color change)
```

### Step 4: Heatmap Validates Results
```
After implementing winner:
Heatmap shows: "Add to Cart" is now red hot!
Clicks increased from 100 to 312 (+212%)
```

**Heatmaps show problems - A/B testing finds solutions - Heatmaps confirm success!**

## Best Practices

### DO:
- Wait for 100+ sessions before analyzing
- Compare mobile vs desktop separately
- Focus on high-traffic pages first
- Combine with A/B testing for validation
- Take screenshots for before/after comparison
- Track metrics before and after changes
- Re-check heatmaps after optimizations

### DON'T:
- Make decisions from 10 sessions (not enough data)
- Ignore mobile heatmaps (50%+ of traffic!)
- Change everything at once (can't track what worked)
- Assume desktop patterns apply to mobile
- Forget to measure impact of changes
- Optimize pages with low traffic (waste of time)
