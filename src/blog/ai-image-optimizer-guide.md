## 🤔 Why AI Image Optimization Matters

### Without AI Image Optimization:
```
You: "I need to remove backgrounds from 50 product photos"
Designer: "That'll take 2 days and cost $500"
You: "...and I need them staged in a living room"
Designer: "Make that a week and $2,000"
*Your product launch gets delayed*
```

### With AI Image Optimization:
```
You: Select 50 images → Click "Remove Background"
AI: Done in 3 minutes → $5 in credits

You: Select same images → Click "Stage in Living Room"
AI: Done in 10 minutes → $12 in credits

*Product launch stays on schedule* 🎉
```

### Real Results:

**What stores achieved with AI images:**
- "Furniture photos staged in rooms" → +45% add-to-cart rate
- "Consistent white backgrounds" → +30% professional appearance
- "4x upscaled images" → Better zoom experience → +12% sales
- "Optimized image sizes" → 2x faster page loads → Better SEO

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Start with Clean Images
```
Good input = Great output

Before optimizing:
✅ Remove obvious defects first
✅ Use highest resolution available
✅ Ensure good lighting in original
```

### 2. Batch Similar Items
```
Processing 20 lamps?
1. Select all 20 in File Library
2. Choose same staging context
3. Bulk optimize in one go
4. Consistent results across catalog
```

### 3. Test Providers
```
Different products work better with different AI:

Furniture → OpenAI (understands room context)
Clothing → Flux (good with fashion)
Electronics → Gemini (clean, precise)
Bulk items → Qwen (save credits)
```

### 4. Use Credits Wisely
```
Credit-saving strategy:

1. Compress (cheap) → Reduce file sizes first
2. Remove BG (medium) → Clean up backgrounds
3. Stage (expensive) → Only for hero images

Don't stage every image - focus on:
- Homepage featured products
- Category heroes
- Social media content
```
